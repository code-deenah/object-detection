# object-detection
Here we are detecting trees for identifying areas with low tree coverage.
we aim to strategically plant trees to reduce pollution. This initiative aligns with our commitment to environmental stewardship, fostering healthier ecosystems, cleaner air, and a sustainable future for all.
Let's plant trees where they're needed most to combat pollution effectively.
